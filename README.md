## Summary

Earl is the offical WordPress theme for Draft Breakdown, built from my WordPress starter theme, [Bootstrapped](http://www.github.com/wspencer428/bootstrapped). Theme development environment uses [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) & [Bower](http://www.bower.io) for automation and package control. Theme is also built with [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com). I kept the theme fully modular in an attempt to make adding features and enhancements even easier. 

In [DB-Delta](http://www.github.com/wspencer428/DB-Delta), I had Player Management handled in a custom plugin I created called [Player Database](http://www.github.com/wspencer428/player-database). Player management is now included as a part of the theme files.

The theme uses APIs from YouTube, Daily Motion and Vimeo to handle video custom post types. I also employed the use of [FitVids](http://www.fitvidsjs.com) to keep the videos fully responsive. 

Additionally, the theme makes full use of the Twitter API as well as GfyCat for gif creation.
